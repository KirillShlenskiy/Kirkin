# Kirkin
Experimental .NET component library. Contains simple but (hopefully) useful low-level .NET types.

No effort is made at this point to keep the API backwards-compatible, even across minor releases, so be prepared for frequent breaking API changes.

The current component status by namespace is as follows:

- `Kirkin.Caching` - unstable
- `Kirkin.ChangeTracking` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Collections.Async` - experimental
- `Kirkin.Collections.Generic` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Collections.Concurrent` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Dependencies` - experimental
- `Kirkin.Functional` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.IO` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Linq` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Linq.Expressions` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Logging` - unstable
- `Kirkin.Mapping` - unstable
- `Kirkin.Reflection` - unstable
- `Kirkin.Text` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Threading` - semi-stable
- `Kirkin.Threading.Tasks` - stable
- `Kirkin.Utilities` - stable

Status definitions:

- *Experimental* = educational purposes only, likely to be changed or scrapped at any time
- *Unstable* = poorly tested and/or likely to change in very near future
- *Semi-stable* = somewhat tested, API less likely to change
- *Stable* = reasonably tested, API not very likely to change
