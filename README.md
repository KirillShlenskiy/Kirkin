Kirkin is an experimental .NET component library. It contains simple but (hopefully) useful low-level .NET types.

No effort is made at this point to keep the API backwards-compatible, even across minor releases, so be prepared for frequent breaking API changes.

The current component status by namespace is as follows:

Namespace | Status
--- | ---
`Kirkin.Caching` | unstable
`Kirkin.ChangeTracking` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Collections.Async` | experimental
`Kirkin.Collections.Filters` | unstable
`Kirkin.Collections.Generic` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Collections.Concurrent` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Collections.Specialised` | unstable
`Kirkin.Dependencies` | experimental
`Kirkin.Functional` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.IO` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Linq` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Linq.Expressions` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Logging` | unstable
`Kirkin.Mapping` | unstable
`Kirkin.Reflection` | unstable
`Kirkin.Text` | unstable
`Kirkin.Threading` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Threading.Tasks` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Utilities` | semi-stable
`Kirkin.Validation` | semi-stable

Status definitions:

- *Experimental* = educational purposes only, likely to be changed or scrapped at any time
- *Unstable* = poorly tested and/or likely to change in very near future
- *Semi-stable* = somewhat tested, API less likely to change
